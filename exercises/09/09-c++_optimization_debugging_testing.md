# Data structure alignment

```cpp
class MyClass
{
  char a;      // 1 byte.
  short int b; // 2 bytes.
  int c;       // 4 bytes.
  char d;      // 1 byte.
};

# Examples

The folder `examples/optimization` contains three examples:

1. **`data_alignment`** compares the memory occupation of two objects containing the same data members but with different data alignment/padding.
2. **`loop_unrolling`** implements a function that multiplies all elements in a `std::vector` by looping over all its elements and returns the result. The executable compares the performance with those obtained exploiting loop unrolling.
3. **`static`** implements a function that allocates a `std::vector` and, taking an index as input, returns the corresponding value. The executable compares the performance with those obtained by declaring the vector `static`.

# Exercise 1: Optimization

The `hints/ex1/` directory contains the implementation of a class for dense matrices organized as **column-major**.

- Implement `Matrix::transpose()`, a method to compute $A = A^T$.
- Implement `operator*`, a function to compute matrix-matrix multiplication.
- Optimize the matrix-matrix multiplication by transposing the first factor before the computation. Compare the execution speed with the previous implementation.
- Use `valgrind --tool=callgrind` to generate a profiler report.
- Generate a coverage report using `lcov` and `genhtml`.

# Debugging

---

# Examples

The content of `examples/debug` was inspired by [this repository](https://github.com/cme212/course/tree/master/notes/lecture-01) and shows basic techniques for debugging as well as an introduction to `gdb`.

# Exercise 2: Debugging

The `hints/ex2/` directory contains an implementation of a double-linked list class. The class stores a pointer to the head, and each node (except for the head and the tail, obviously) contains a pointer to the previous and to the next node.

The implementation contains a lot of errors, namely:

1. Compilation and syntax errors.
2. Runtime errors, including a segmentation fault and a problem in printing the list.
3. Memory leaks.
4. Two possible *segmentation fault*s, not captured by the `main`.

With the help of `gdb` and `valgrind`, solve all these issues and make the code working!

# Testing

---

# Exercise 3: Testing

The `hints/ex3/` contains a static function to compute the mean of a `std::vector`.

Following the given directory structure and using [Google Test](https://google.github.io/googletest/), fill in the missing parts in `tests/mean.cpp` to check that the function behaves as expected in all the listed cases.

To run the testsuite type
```bash
make test
```
or
```bash
ctest
```
from the CMake build folder.
