# Purpose
The homework assignments in the "Advanced Programming" course are designed to reinforce your understanding of advanced programming concepts and provide practical experience in solving complex programming problems. These assignments are **not** mandatory but are encouraged as valuable learning opportunities.

# Submission guidelines
## Deadline
All homework assignments must be submitted by the specified deadline. Late submissions may not be accepted, and late penalties may apply. Requests for deadline extensions should be made in advance and only under exceptional circumstances.

## Groups
You have the option to work in **groups of up to 3 members**. If you choose to work in a group, the submission should clearly list **all** group members, their email addresses and a short list of individual contributions. Each group should submit **one** assignment collectively.

## Format
Submit your assignments on the  platform. Attach a single .tar or .zip archive named "AssignmentX_Surname(s).xyz".

**Note:** **Do not** upload or include generated files such as executables, object files, or libraries. **Only** submit the source code and provide clear instructions for compilation or, preferably, include a **build script**.

## Code
Carefully read and follow the assignment instructions provided. Include comments and documentation within your code to explain your thought process, algorithms, and any relevant design decisions. Strive for high-quality code that is readable, efficient, and follows best coding practices. Proper indentation, naming conventions, and error handling are essential. Test your code thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.

## Plagiarism
Plagiarism will not be tolerated. Always cite your sources and ensure that your work is entirely your own. Any form of academic dishonesty will result in severe penalties.

# Grading and feedback

## Grading
Grading will be based on the correctness of your solutions, code quality, clarity of build instructions, documentation, adherence to instructions, and timeliness of submission. Each assignment will be evaluated ranging **from 0 to 5 points**, which will contribute to your final grade ([exam rules](exam_rules.md)). Missing submissions solution for any assignment will result in a score of 0 points. The average of your assignment scores will be added to your final exam grade.

## Feedback
Upon request, you will receive feedback on your assignments, including comments on your code and suggestions for improvement.

# Miscellaneous

## External resources
You are free to use external resources (books, online documentation, forums) for reference and learning. However, make sure to acknowledge any external sources or tools you consult or use in your documentation.

## Backup
Maintain backups of your work to prevent data loss.

## Questions
If you have questions or need clarifications about an assignment, contact the instructor or tutor well before the submission deadline.
