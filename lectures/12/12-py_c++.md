# Integrating C++ and Python

---

# Why integrating C++ and Python code

C++ and Python are powerful in their own right, but they excel in different areas. C++ is renowned for its performance and control over system resources, making it ideal for CPU-intensive tasks and systems programming. Python, on the other hand, is celebrated for its simplicity, readability, and vast ecosystem of libraries, especially in data science, machine learning, and web development.

- In research areas like machine learning, scientific computing, and data analysis, the need for processing speed and efficient resource management is critical.
- The industry often requires solutions that are both efficient and rapidly developed.

By integrating C++ with Python, you can create applications that harness the raw power of C++ and the versatility and ease-of-use of Python. Python, despite its popularity in these fields, often falls short in terms of performance. Knowledge of how to integrate C++ and Python equips with a highly valuable skill set.

---

# Common libraries for C++ and Python integration (1/5)

Integrating C++ and Python code is a common need in software development, especially when you want to combine the high performance of C++ with the ease of use of Python. Several libraries are available for this purpose, each with its own set of advantages and drawbacks. Here are some of the most commonly used libraries:

1. [**Boost.Python**](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_84_0/libs/python/doc/html/index.html)
   - Pros:
     - Well-documented, widely used.
     - Seamless interoperability between C++ and Python.
     - Exposes C++ classes to Python and vice versa.
   - Cons:
     - Complex setup for beginners.
     - Larger binary size.
     - Slower compile times.

# pybind11: installation

---

# pybind11 overview

pybind11 is a lightweight, header-only library that connects C++ types with Python. This tool is crucial for creating Python bindings of existing C++ code. Its design and functionality are similar to the Boost.Python library but with a focus on simplicity and minimalism. pybind11 stands out for its ability to avoid the complexities associated with Boost by leveraging C++11 features.

[Documentation link](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)

---

# How to install (1/3)

There are multiple methods to acquire the pybind11 source, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11). The recommended approaches include via PyPI, through Conda, building from source, or importing it as a Git submodule.

## Include with PyPI

pybind11 can be installed as a Python package from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install pybind11
```

## Include with conda-forge

Conda users can obtain pybind11 via conda-forge:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pybind11
```

---

# How to install (2/3)

## Global install with brew

For macOS and Linux users, the brew package manager offers pybind11. Install it using:

```bash
brew install pybind11
```

## Build from source

If you prefer to build from source, use the following commands:

```bash
wget https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/archive/refs/tags/v2.11.1.tar.gz
tar xzvf v2.11.1.tar.gz

cd pybind11-2.11.1/
mkdir build && cd build

cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/pybind11
[sudo] make -j<N> install
```

---

# How to install (4/4)

## Include as a submodule

For Git-based projects, pybind11 can be incorporated as a submodule. In your Git repository, execute the following commands:

```bash
git submodule add -b stable https://github.com/pybind/pybind11 extern/pybind11
git submodule update --init
```

This method assumes dependency placement in `extern/`. Remember, some servers might require the `.git` extension.

After setup, include `extern/pybind11/include` in your project, or employ pybind11's integration tools.

# pybind11: basics

---

# Header and namespace conventions

For brevity, all code examples assume that the following two lines are present:

```cpp
#include <pybind11/pybind11.h>
namespace py = pybind11;
```

Some features may require additional headers, but those will be specified as needed.

---

# Creating bindings for a simple function

Let's start by creating Python bindings for an extremely simple function, which adds two numbers and returns their result. For simplicity, we'll put both this function and the binding code into a file named `example.cpp` with the following contents:

```cpp
int add(int i, int j) {
    return i + j;
}

PYBIND11_MODULE(example, m) {
    m.doc() = "pybind11 example plugin"; // Optional module docstring.

    m.def("add", &add, "A function that adds two numbers");
}
```

In practice, implementation and binding code will generally be located in separate files.

---

# The `PYBIND11_MODULE` macro

The `PYBIND11_MODULE` macro creates a function that will be called when an `import` statement is issued from within Python. The module name (`example`) is given as the first macro argument (it should not be in quotes). The second argument (`m`) defines a variable of type `py::module_ <module>` which is the main interface for creating bindings. The method `module_::def` generates binding code that exposes the `add()` function to Python.

---

# Note (1/2)

Notice how little code was needed to expose our function to Python: all details regarding the function's parameters and return value were automatically inferred using template metaprogramming. This overall approach and the used syntax are borrowed from Boost.Python, though the underlying implementation is very different.

pybind11 is a header-only library, hence it is not necessary to link against any special libraries and there are no intermediate (magic) translation steps. On Linux, the above example can be compiled using the following command:

```bash
g++ -O3 -Wall -shared -std=c++11 -fPIC \
    $(python3 -m pybind11 --includes) \
    example.cpp -o example$(python3-config --extension-suffix)
```

If you included pybind11 as a Git submodule, then use `$(python3-config --includes) -Iextern/pybind11/include` instead of `$(python3 -m pybind11 --includes)` in the above compilation.

---

# Note (2/2)

The `python3 -m pybind11 --includes` command fetches the include paths for both pybind11 and Python headers. This assumes that pybind11 has been installed using `pip` or `conda`. If it hasn't, you can also manually specify `-I <path-to-pybind11>/include` together with the Python includes path `python3-config --includes`.

On macOS: the build command is almost the same but it also requires passing the `-undefined dynamic_lookup` flag so as to ignore missing symbols when building the module.

---

# How to import a C++ bound module

Building the above C++ code will produce a binary module file that can be imported to Python. Assuming that the compiled module is located in the current directory, the following interactive Python session shows how to load and execute the example:

```python
import example
example.add(1, 2) # Output: 3
```

---

# Keyword arguments

With a simple code modification, it is possible to inform Python about the names of the arguments ("i" and "j" in this case).

```cpp
m.def("add", &add, "A function which adds two numbers",
      py::arg("i"), py::arg("j"));
```

`arg` is one of several special tag classes which can be used to pass metadata into `module_::def`. With this modified binding code, we can now call the function using keyword arguments, which is a more readable alternative particularly for functions taking many parameters:

```python
import example
example.add(i=1, j=2) # Output: 3L
```

---

# Documentation

The keyword names also appear in the function signatures within the documentation.

```python
help(example)
```
>    ```
>    ...
>    FUNCTIONS
>        add(...)
>            Signature : (i: int, j: int) -> int
>
>            A function which adds two numbers
>    ```

---

# Shorthand for keyword arguments

A shorter notation for named arguments is also available:

```cpp
// Regular notation.
m.def("add1", &add, py::arg("i"), py::arg("j"));

// Shorthand.
using namespace py::literals;
m.def("add2", &add, "i"_a, "j"_a);
```

The `_a` suffix forms a C++11 literal which is equivalent to `arg`. Note that the literal operator must first be made visible with the directive `using namespace py::literals`. This does not bring in anything else from the `pybind11` namespace except for literals.

---

# Default arguments

Suppose now that the function to be bound has default arguments, e.g.:

```cpp
int add(int i = 1, int j = 2) {
    return i + j;
}
```

Unfortunately, pybind11 cannot automatically extract these parameters, since they are not part of the function's type information. However, they are simple to specify using an extension of `arg`:
```cpp
// Regular notation.
m.def("add", &add, "A function which adds two numbers", py::arg("i") = 1, py::arg("j") = 2);

// Shorthand.
m.def("add2", &add, "i"_a=1, "j"_a=2);
```

The default values also appear within the documentation.

---

# Exporting variables

To expose a value from C++, use the `attr` function to register it in a module as shown below. Built-in types and general objects (more on that later) are automatically converted when assigned as attributes, and can be explicitly converted using the function `py::cast`.

```cpp
PYBIND11_MODULE(example, m) {
    m.attr("the_answer") = 42;
    py::object world = py::cast("World");
    m.attr("what") = world;
}
```

These are then accessible from Python:

```python
import example
example.the_answer # Output: 42
example.what # Output: 'World'
```

---

# Supported data types

A large number of data types are supported out of the box and can be used seamlessly as functions arguments, return values or with `py::cast` in general.

For a full overview, see the [official documentation](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/cast/index.html).

# pybind11: binding object-oriented code

---

# Creating bindings for a custom type

Let's now look at a more complex example where we'll create bindings for a custom C++ data structure named `Pet`.

```cpp
struct Pet {
    Pet(const std::string &name) : name(name) { }
    void set_name(const std::string &name_) { name = name_; }
    const std::string &get_name() const { return name; }

    std::string name;
};

PYBIND11_MODULE(example, m) {
    py::class_<Pet>(m, "Pet")
        .def(py::init<const std::string &>())
        .def("set_name", &Pet::set_name)
        .def("get_name", &Pet::get_name);
}
```

---

# `class_`

`class_` creates bindings for a C++ *class* or *struct*-style data structure. `init` is a convenience function that takes the types of a **constructor**'s parameters as template arguments and wraps the corresponding constructor. An interactive Python session demonstrating this example is shown below:

```python
import example
p = example.Pet("Molly")
print(p) # Output: <example.Pet object at 0x10cd98060>
p.get_name() # Output: 'Molly'
p.set_name("Charly")
p.get_name() # Output: 'Charly'
```

**Note**: Static member functions can be bound in the same way using `class_::def_static`.
**Note**: It is possible to specify keyword and default arguments using the syntax discussed in the previous section.

---

# Binding lambda functions (1/2)

Note how `print(p)` produced a rather useless summary of our data structure in the example above:

```python
print(p) # Output: <example.Pet object at 0x10cd98060>
```

To address this, we could bind a utility function that returns a human-readable summary to the special method slot named `__repr__`. Unfortunately, there is no suitable functionality in the `Pet` data structure, and it would be nice if we did not have to change it.

---

# Binding lambda functions (2/2)

This can easily be accomplished by binding a lambda function instead:

```cpp
py::class_<Pet>(m, "Pet")
    .def(py::init<const std::string &>())
    .def("set_name", &Pet::set_name)
    .def("get_name", &Pet::get_name)
    .def("__repr__",
         [](const Pet &a) {
             return "<example.Pet named '" + a.name + "'>";
         }
    );
```

With the above change, the same Python code now produces the following output:

```python
print(p) # Output: <example.Pet named 'Molly'>
```

---

# Instance and static fields

We can also directly expose the `name` field using the `class_::def_readwrite` method. A similar `class_::def_readonly` method also exists for `const` fields.

```cpp
py::class_<Pet>(m, "Pet")
    .def(py::init<const std::string &>())
    .def_readwrite("name", &Pet::name)
    // ...
```

This makes it possible to write

```python
p = example.Pet("Molly")
p.name # Output: 'Molly'
p.name = "Charly"
p.name # Output: 'Charly'
```

---

# Private fields (1/2)

Now suppose that `Pet::name` was a private internal variable that can only be accessed via setters and getters.

```cpp
class Pet {
public:
    Pet(const std::string &name) : name(name) { }
    void set_name(const std::string &name_) { name = name_; }
    const std::string &get_name() const { return name; }
    
private:
    std::string name;
};
```

---

# Private fields (2/2)

In this case, the method `class_::def_property` (`class_::def_property_readonly` for read-only data) can be used to provide a field-like interface within Python that will transparently call the setter and getter functions:

```cpp
py::class_<Pet>(m, "Pet")
    .def(py::init<const std::string &>())
    .def_property("name", &Pet::get_name, &Pet::set_name)
    // ...
```

Write only properties can be defined by passing `nullptr` as the input for the read function.

**Note**: Similar functions `class_::def_readwrite_static`, `class_::def_readonly_static` `class_::def_property_static`, and `class_::def_property_readonly_static` are provided for binding static variables and properties.

---

# Dynamic attributes (1/3)

Native Python classes can pick up new attributes dynamically:

```python
class Pet:
    name = "Molly"

p = Pet()
p.name = "Charly" # Overwrite existing.
p.age = 2 # Dynamically add a new attribute.
```

---

# Dynamic attributes (2/3)

By default, classes exported from C++ do not support this and the only writable
attributes are the ones explicitly defined using `class_::def_readwrite`
or `class_::def_property`.

```cpp
py::class_<Pet>(m, "Pet")
    .def(py::init<>())
    .def_readwrite("name", &Pet::name);
```

Trying to set any other attribute results in an error:

```python
p = example.Pet()
p.name = "Charly" # Ok: attribute defined in C++.
p.age = 2
```
> AttributeError: 'Pet' object has no attribute 'age'

---

# Dynamic attributes (3/3)

The `py::dynamic_attr` tag enables dynamic attributes for C++ classes:

```cpp
py::class_<Pet>(m, "Pet", py::dynamic_attr())
    .def(py::init<>())
    .def_readwrite("name", &Pet::name);
```

Now everything works as expected:

```python
p = example.Pet()
p.name = "Charly" # Ok: overwrite value in C++.
p.age = 2 # Ok: dynamically add a new attribute.
p.__dict__  # Output: {'age': 2}
```

Note that there is a small runtime cost for a class with dynamic attributes. Not only because of the addition of a `__dict__`, but also because of more expensive garbage collection tracking which must be activated to resolve possible circular references. Native Python classes incur this same cost by default.

---

# Inheritance, downcasting and polymorphism (1/6)

Suppose now that the example consists of two data structures with an inheritance relationship:

```cpp
struct Pet {
    Pet(const std::string &name) : name(name) { }
    std::string name;
};

struct Dog : Pet {
    Dog(const std::string &name) : Pet(name) { }
    std::string bark() const { return "woof!"; }
};
```

---

# Inheritance, downcasting and polymorphism (2/6)

There are two different ways of indicating a hierarchical relationship to pybind11: the first specifies the C++ base class as an extra template parameter of the `class_`:

```cpp
py::class_<Pet>(m, "Pet")
    .def(py::init<const std::string &>())
    .def_readwrite("name", &Pet::name);

// Method 1: template parameter:.
py::class_<Dog, Pet /* C++ parent type. */>(m, "Dog")
    .def(py::init<const std::string &>())
    .def("bark", &Dog::bark);
```

---

# Inheritance, downcasting and polymorphism (3/6)

Alternatively, we can also assign a name to the previously bound `Pet`
`class_` object and reference it when binding the `Dog` class:

```cpp
py::class_<Pet> pet(m, "Pet");
pet.def(py::init<const std::string &>())
   .def_readwrite("name", &Pet::name);

// Method 2: pass parent class_ object.
py::class_<Dog>(m, "Dog", pet /* <- Specify Python parent instance. */)
    .def(py::init<const std::string &>())
    .def("bark", &Dog::bark);
```

---

# Inheritance, downcasting and polymorphism (4/6)

Functionality-wise, both approaches are equivalent.

```python
p = example.Dog("Molly")
p.name # Output: 'Molly'
p.bark() # Output: 'woof!'
```

The C++ classes defined above are regular non-polymorphic types with an inheritance relationship. This is reflected in Python:

```cpp
// Return a base pointer to a derived instance.
m.def("pet_store", [](){ return std::unique_ptr<Pet>(new Dog("Molly")); });
```

```python
p = example.pet_store()
type(p) # Output: Pet
# No pointer downcasting for regular non-polymorphic types.
p.bark() # Output: AttributeError: 'Pet' object has no attribute 'bark'
```

---

# Inheritance, downcasting and polymorphism (5/6)

The function returned a `Dog` instance, but because it's a non-polymorphic type behind a base pointer, Python only sees a `Pet`. In C++, a type is only considered polymorphic if it has at least one virtual function and pybind11 will automatically recognize this:

```cpp
struct PolymorphicPet {
    virtual ~PolymorphicPet() = default;
};

struct PolymorphicDog : PolymorphicPet {
    std::string bark() const { return "woof!"; }
};

py::class_<PolymorphicPet>(m, "PolymorphicPet");
py::class_<PolymorphicDog, PolymorphicPet>(m, "PolymorphicDog")
    .def(py::init<>())
    .def("bark", &PolymorphicDog::bark);

// Again, return a base pointer to a derived instance.
m.def("pet_store2", []() { return std::unique_ptr<PolymorphicPet>(new PolymorphicDog); });
```

---

# Inheritance, downcasting and polymorphism (6/6)

```python
p = example.pet_store2()
type(p) # Output: PolymorphicDog
p.bark() # Output: 'woof!'
```

Given a pointer to a polymorphic base, pybind11 performs automatic downcasting to the actual derived type. Note that this goes beyond the usual situation in C++: we don't just get access to the virtual functions of the base, we get the concrete derived type including functions and attributes that the base type may not even be aware of.

---

# Overloaded methods (1/2)

Sometimes there are several overloaded C++ methods with the same name taking different kinds of input arguments:

```cpp
struct Pet {
    Pet(const std::string &name, int age) : name(name), age(age) { }

    void set(int age_) { age = age_; }
    void set(const std::string &name_) { name = name_; }

    std::string name;
    int age;
};
```

Attempting to bind `Pet::set` will cause an error since the compiler does not know which method the user intended to select.

---

# Overloaded methods (2/2)

We can disambiguate by casting them to function pointers. Binding multiple functions to the same Python name automatically creates a chain of function overloads that will be tried in sequence.

```cpp
py::class_<Pet>(m, "Pet")
    .def(py::init<const std::string &, int>())
    .def("set", static_cast<void (Pet::*)(int)>(&Pet::set), "Set the pet's age")
    .def("set", static_cast<void (Pet::*)(const std::string &)>(&Pet::set), "Set the pet's name");
```

The overload signatures are also visible in the method's docstring. If you have a C++14 compatible compiler, you can use an alternative syntax to cast the overloaded function:

```cpp
py::class_<Pet>(m, "Pet")
    .def("set", py::overload_cast<int>(&Pet::set), "Set the pet's age")
    .def("set", py::overload_cast<const std::string &>(&Pet::set), "Set the pet's name");
```

Here, `py::overload_cast` only requires the parameter types to be specified. The return type and class are deduced.

---

# Overloaded `const` methods

If a function is overloaded based on constness, the `py::const_` tag should be used:

```cpp
struct Widget {
    int foo(int x, float y);
    int foo(int x, float y) const;
};

py::class_<Widget>(m, "Widget")
    .def("foo_mutable", py::overload_cast<int, float>(&Widget::foo))
    .def("foo_const",   py::overload_cast<int, float>(&Widget::foo, py::const_));
```

**Note**: this approach also works for multiple overloaded constructors.

---

# Enumerations and internal types (1/2)

Let's now suppose that the example class contains internal types like enumerations, e.g.:

```cpp
struct Pet {
    enum Kind {
        Dog = 0,
        Cat
    };

    struct Attributes {
        float age = 0;
    };

    Pet(const std::string &name, Kind type) : name(name), type(type) { }

    std::string name;
    Kind type;
    Attributes attr;
};
```

---

# Enumerations and internal types (2/2)

The binding code for this example looks as follows:

```cpp
py::class_<Pet> pet(m, "Pet");

pet.def(py::init<const std::string &, Pet::Kind>())
    .def_readwrite("name", &Pet::name)
    .def_readwrite("type", &Pet::type)
    .def_readwrite("attr", &Pet::attr);

py::enum_<Pet::Kind>(pet, "Kind")
    .value("Dog", Pet::Kind::Dog)
    .value("Cat", Pet::Kind::Cat)
    .export_values();

py::class_<Pet::Attributes>(pet, "Attributes")
    .def(py::init<>())
    .def_readwrite("age", &Pet::Attributes::age);
```

---

# Scoping

To ensure that the nested types `Kind` and `Attributes` are created within the scope of `Pet`, the `pet` `class_` instance must be supplied to the `enum_` and `class_` constructor. The `enum_::export_values` function exports the enum entries into the parent scope, which should be skipped for newer C++11-style enum classes.

```python
p = Pet("Lucy", Pet.Cat)
p.type # Output: Kind.Cat
int(p.type) # Output: 1L
```

The entries defined by the enumeration type are exposed in the `__members__` property:

```python
Pet.Kind.__members__ # Output: {'Dog': Kind.Dog, 'Cat': Kind.Cat}
```

The `name` property returns the name of the enum value as a unicode string. Contrary to Python customs, enum values from the wrappers should not be compared using `is`, but with `==`.

# How to build and import pybind11 modules

The [Python example](https://github.com/pybind/python_example) and [CMake example](https://github.com/pybind/cmake_example) repositories good places to start to understand how to build and import pybind11 modules. There are three main ways to do it:

1. Manual compilation.
2. Compilation using `CMake`.
3. Compilation using `setuptools`.

In order to be able to import the compiled module in Python, add the folder containing your dynamic library to the environment variable `PYTHONPATH` accordingly.

---

# Manual compilation

To manually compile C++ code with pybind11, use one of the following commands:
```bash
# pybind11 installed via pip or conda.
g++ -O3 -Wall -shared -std=c++11 -fPIC \
    $(python3 -m pybind11 --includes) \
    example.cpp -o example$(python3-config --extension-suffix)

# pybind11 built from source.
g++ -std=c++11 -O3 -shared -fPIC \
    -I/path/to/pybind11/include $(python3-config --cflags --ldflags --libs) \
    example.cpp -o example$(python3-config --extension-suffix)

# pybind11 included as a Git submodule.
g++ -std=c++11 -O3 -shared -fPIC \
    -Iextern/pybind11/include $(python3-config --cflags --ldflags --libs) \
    example.cpp -o example$(python3-config --extension-suffix)

```

On macOS: add the `-undefined dynamic_lookup` flag so as to ignore missing symbols when building the module.

# How to compile using CMake (1/2)

To compile and run your pybind11 code with CMake, create a `CMakeLists.txt` script as follows:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)
project(example)

find_package(pybind11 REQUIRED)
include_directories(SYSTEM ${pybind11_INCLUDE_DIRS})
pybind11_add_module(example example.cpp)
```

or, if pybind11 is included as a subfolder:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)
project(example)

add_subdirectory(pybind11)
pybind11_add_module(example example.cpp)
```

Please refer to the [CMake example](https://github.com/pybind/cmake_example) repository for further details.

Then:

```bash
cd /path/to/example/
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -Dpybind11_DIR=/path/to/pybind ..
make -j<N>
```

---

# How to compile using `setuptools` (1/3)

For projects on PyPI, building with setuptools is the way to go. Sylvain Corlay has kindly provided an example project which shows how to set up everything, including automatic generation of documentation using Sphinx. Please refer to the [Python example](https://github.com/pybind/python_example) repository for further details.

`setup.py` is a Python script commonly used in Python projects for tasks like building, distributing, and installing module packages. In pybind11, it compiles and links C++ code into Python modules.

---

# How to compile using `setuptools` (2/3)

Example of a `setup.py` file:

<div class="columns">
<div>

```python
from setuptools import setup, Extension
from setuptools.command.build_ext import build_ext
import sys
import setuptools

class get_pybind_include(object):
    # Helper class to determine the pybind11 include path.
    def __str__(self):
        import pybind11
        return pybind11.get_include()

ext_modules = [
    Extension(
        'your_module_name',  # Name of the module.
        ['your_module.cpp'],  # C++ source files.
        include_dirs=[
            get_pybind_include(),  # Path to pybind11 includes.
            '/path/to/other/includes',  # Additional include paths.
        ],
        language='c++'
    ),
]
```

</div>
<div>

```python
setup(
    name='your_module_name',
    version='0.1',
    author='Your Name',
    author_email='your.email@example.com',
    description='A Python module using pybind11',
    long_description='',
    ext_modules=ext_modules,
    install_requires=['pybind11>=2.5.0'],  # pybind11 requirement.
    cmdclass={'build_ext': build_ext},
    zip_safe=False,
)
```

</div>

# How to compile using `setuptools` (3/3)

1. **Create the `setup.py` file**: Place it in your project's root directory.
2. **Modify the file**: Change `your_module_name` and `your_module.cpp` to your module's name and C++ source file name. Adjust paths as needed.
3. **Build the module**:
   ```bash
   python setup.py build_ext --inplace
   ```
   This compiles the C++ code into a shared object file (.so).
4. **Install the module**:
   ```bash
   python setup.py install # Or: pip install .
   ```

The build step of `setuptools` can be run through CMake itself. The [CMake example](https://github.com/pybind/cmake_example) repository provides a prototype `setup.py` to adjust to your needs

**Note**: A similar approach using a [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/pybind/cmake_example/blob/master/pyproject.toml) file is also possible.

# Examples

# C++ vs. native Python benchmark (1/2)

The example provided in the `c++_vs_py` folder showcases a performance comparison test between bound C++ code and native Python code on a simple linear algebra operation, such as a matrix-matrix product.

The code can be compiled with:
```bash
g++ -O3 -Wall -shared -std=c++11 -fPIC \
    $(python3 -m pybind11 --includes) \
    matrix_multiplication.cpp -o matrix_ops$(python3-config --extension-suffix)
```

---

# C++ vs. native Python benchmark (2/2)

**Expected results**
Typically, the C++ implementation should be significantly faster than the pure Python implementation for several reasons:
- **Execution speed**: C++ is a compiled language and is generally faster than Python, an interpreted language, especially for computation-intensive tasks.
- **Optimization**: Compilers for C++ can optimize the code for performance, whereas Python's flexibility and dynamic typing can introduce overhead.
- **Handling of loops**: C++ is more efficient in handling loops and arithmetic operations compared to Python.

---

# Notes

- The actual performance gain can vary depending on the system, the size of the matrices, and the compiler optimizations.
- For matrix operations, libraries like NumPy in Python are highly optimized and can offer performance close to C++, but in this comparison, we are using a pure Python implementation to illustrate the difference more clearly.
- Remember that developing and maintaining C++ code requires more effort compared to Python, so the decision to use C++ should consider both performance benefits and development costs.

# Other examples

The examples provided in the `examples` folder are adapted and extended versions from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/tdegeus/pybind11_examples). They demonstrate the use of pybind11 in various scenarios.
