## Exam structure
The main exam will consist of two parts:
- Part 1: 10 open-ended questions will test theoretical understanding and application of concepts.
- Part 2: 1 programming exercise will assess practical skills in coding and problem-solving.

Optionally and after the main exam, an oral exam may be requested by either the student or the instructor.

Allowed programming languages include C++, Python, GNU Makefile, CMake, and shell scripting languages.

## Content
The exam will encompass all the topics and material outlined in the [course syllabus](syllabus.md). This includes, but is not limited to, lecture notes, recordings, examples, exercises and their solutions, and any additional resources referenced. Students are expected to be familiar with the entire range of content covered throughout the course for the examination.

# Time allocation

- The exam will be 3 hours long (1 hour for part 1 + 2 hours for part 2)
- Submissions after the deadline will not be accepted.

## Format
The exam submissions will be conducted through the Google Form system. Please make sure to provide valid personal information and email address.

**Maintain backups of your work to prevent data loss.**

## Part 1: Open-ended questions
- Answers to open-ended questions must be handwritten on paper and delivered to the instructor. The use of computers and other electronic devices is forbidden for part 1.

## Part 2: Programming exercise
- Solutions to the programming exercise must be submitted as a single `.zip` or `.tar` archive containing only source code files, documentation and any other relevant information.
- Please include a README.md file with a brief explanation of the code structure and instructions for building and running your code.
- Name the archive file with your full name and/or student ID as `part2_Surname_Name_ID.{zip,tar.gz}`.

:warning: **NB**: no object or binary file should be uploaded.

# Exam rules

## Open book policy
For part 2, students may refer to textbooks, notes, and other resources. This policy is designed to encourage reasoning and the application of knowledge rather than rote memorization.

## Restrictions
The use of AI tools, online forums, social media, and communication with others during the exam is strictly prohibited. Violations will result in severe penalties.

## Honesty and plagiarism
All the answers and code must be original and written by the student.
Academic integrity must be upheld. Plagiarism will not be tolerated. Always **cite your sources** and ensure that your work is entirely your own. Any form of academic dishonesty and cheating will result in severe penalties or disqualification.

## Questions and technical issues
If you have questions or experience technical issues during the exam, please inform the exam invigilator immediately.

# Evaluation criteria

## Part 1: 10 open-ended questions (up to 1 point each)
- Clarity of expression.
- Depth of understanding of the theoretical concepts.
- Application and analysis of knowledge.

## Part 2: Programming exercise (up to 15 points)
- Syntactical and logical correctness of the code.
- Clarity and organization of code.
- Code testing and efficiency.
- Proper use of programming constructs and data structures covered during the course.
- Code documentation and comments, explaining your design choices, how to build and run the program, its logic and flow.
- Successful compilation and execution, fulfilling the given problem statement.
- (Bonus) Use of programming constructs and data structures beyond the course content.

Unless otherwise specified, you are encouraged to incorporate any third-party open-source library into your project.

## (Optional) Homework assignments (increase by up to 5 points)
The average of students' scores for homework assignment will be added to the exam grade.

## (Optional) Oral exam (increase or decrease by up to 3 points)
- Clarity of expression.
- Depth of understanding of the theoretical concepts.
- Application and analysis of knowledge.

## The maximum achievable grade in the main exam is 25.
The final grade will be calculated by adding the grades from the main exam, homework assignments, and (if applicable, with its respective sign) the oral exam.
Honors may be granted in exceptional cases, provided the final grade exceeds 30.
