# Objective

Develop a toolbox in C++ covering various data science and scientific computing areas.
Implement **module A)** and **one module among B), C), D)**, of your choice.

## Components

A) **Statistics module** **:warning: <alert>(mandatory)</alert>**

B) **Interpolation module**

C) **Numerical integration module**

D) **ODE module**

Requirements and descriptions for each module are provided in the sections below.

---

# A) Statistics module **:warning: <alert>(mandatory)</alert>**

Implement a module to perform statistical analyses on data imported from a `CSV` or a `JSON` file and output relevant information to a text file. Parse input and output filenames as command line arguments.

- Implement utilities for statistical operations like mean, median, standard deviation, variance, frequency count, classification, and correlation analyses.
- Implement iterators for seamless data traversal.
- Consider using `std::variant` for storing numerical or categorical data and `std::optional` for possibly missing/NA values.
- Select a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/), and use it to test your implementation by performing statistical analysis on a real application.

# B) Interpolation module

Implement a module to support [**composite** linear and polynomial interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation), and (**bonus**) [cardinal cubic B-spline interpolation](https://live.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/libs/math/doc/html/math_toolkit/cardinal_cubic_b.html) of a given set of data $\lbrace(x_i, y_i)\rbrace \subset \mathbb{R}^2$.

- Implement a common interface that stores a list of nodes $\lbrace x_i \rbrace$ over an interval $[a, b]$ and the corresponding observed values $\lbrace y_i \rbrace$ for all kinds of interpolation.
- The implemented class(es) should expose a call operator (`operator()`) returning the interpolated value at a given point.
- Test your implementation through practical examples. Showcase the accuracy, efficiency, and order of convergence of each method implemented.

# C) Numerical integration module

Implement a module for approximating integrals using **composite** numerical integration formulas of the form

$$
\int_a^b f(x) dx \approx \sum_{i=1}^N w_i f(x_i),
$$

where $\lbrace w_i \rbrace$ and $\lbrace x_i \rbrace$ are the weights and nodes of the quadrature formula, respectively.

- Consider methods such as the [midpoint rule, the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule](https://math.umd.edu/~petersd/460/numint460.pdf), and (**bonus**) [Gaussian quadrature formulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_quadrature).
- Test your implementation through practical examples. Showcase the accuracy, efficiency, and order of convergence of each method implemented.

---

# D) ODE module

Implement a module for solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) of the form

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{y}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{f}(t, \mathbf{y}),
$$

where $\mathbf{y}\in \mathbb{R}^N, \mathbf{f} : \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^N$, using [explicit Runge-Kutta methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods#Explicit_Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods), such as Forward Euler, RK4, and (**bonus**) the explicit midpoint method.

- The module should handle both scalar ($N=1$) and vector ODE problems.
- Output the solution to a `CSV` file with header columns `t, y1, y2, ..., yN`.
- Test your implementation through practical examples. Showcase the accuracy, stability, efficiency, and order of convergence of each method implemented.

# General guidelines

1. Emphasize the use of **modern C++** features, including STL containers, algorithms, iterators, smart pointers, and other utilities.
2. Utilize either *run-time* (class abstraction and inheritance) or *compile-time* (templates and policies) polymorphism, **providing motivation for your choice**.
3. Write error-safe code and **handle exceptions properly**.
4. Provide **clear documentation** of code design, algorithms, and decisions made.
5. Promote **code readability**, **modular design**, and adherence to **coding standards**.
6. Provide **sample applications** demonstrating the functionality of each module.

# Integration of third-party libraries

- The integration of third-party libraries is highly encouraged, such as:
  - [`Boost`](https://www.boost.org/) (e.g., the modules `Histogram`, `JSON`, `Math`, `Odeint`).
  - [`Eigen`](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), for linear algebra classes (vectors, matrices, linear solvers).
  - [`GetPot`](https://getpot.sourceforge.net/), for parsing comand line arguments and configuration files.
  - [`GNU GSL`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/), for a wide range of mathematical routines.
  - [`muParserX`](https://beltoforion.de/en/muparserx/), to parse string expressions such as `"sin(pi * x) * exp(x)"` as mathematical functions.
  
  or any other library of your choice, and showcase their synergy with your code.
- Discuss considerations and challenges in using third-party libraries.

---

# Code organization

- Organize your implementation into subfolders and files with meaningful names.
- Ensure a clear separation between function declarations and definitions by placing them in different files whenever possible.
- The **2** modules implemented should be part of the same framework, e.g., by sharing namespaces, styling, and common utilities. However, each of them should be **compilable as a standalone shared library**, allowing independent use.
- Before submission, ensure your code's compatibility with various compilers by testing it, e.g. on [GodBolt](https://godbolt.org/), and enabling the following [compilation flags](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html):

  ```bash
  -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -Wpendantic -Werror
  ```

# Submission

1. Include a `README` file that:
   - Clearly states **which module(s)** you implemented.
   - Lists all **group members** with their name, email address, and highlights their **individual contribution** to the project.
   - Provides a concise discussion of the obtained results, such as insights from statistical analyses, observations on the convergence order of implemented methods, and any other pertinent information.
2. Provide a working compilation script as the preferred method for building the libraries and testing your implementation. Clearly specify the commands needed to compile the code successfully. **Bonus**: use `Makefile` or `CMake` as build tools.
3. Submit a **single** compressed file (named `Homework_02_Surname1_Surname2.ext`) containing all source code, the `README`, and any other relevant files or third-party libraries (please comply to their licences).
